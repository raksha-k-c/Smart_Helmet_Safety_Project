# 🪖 Smart Helmet Safety Project (Concept Phase)

A conceptual project aimed at improving road safety through an intelligent helmet that detects motion, accidents, and alerts emergency services.

---

## 💡 Project Idea

Motorcycle riders are often vulnerable to accidents with delayed response times. This project proposes a smart helmet that detects motion (fall or crash) and sends immediate alerts with location tracking.

---

## 🔧 Proposed Components

- Accelerometer / Gyroscope sensors
- GPS module
- GSM module for sending SMS alerts
- Microcontroller (Arduino / ESP32)
- Rechargeable power source

---

## 📌 Key Features (Planned)

- Crash detection using motion sensors
- Emergency SMS alert with GPS location
- Helmet-wear detection for ignition lock
- Buzzer or indicator alerts

---

## 🛠 Current Status

- 🧠 Idea formulated and components shortlisted  
- 📝 Design draft under progress  
- 📦 Hardware implementation yet to begin

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Prepare simulation circuit and component testing  
- Build prototype using ESP32 or Arduino  
- Test and validate sensor response  
- Integrate GPS and GSM for live alert

---

## 🧠 Learning Goal

To apply embedded systems knowledge in a real-world medical/vehicular safety context.
